## Parameter API

Go to the [ACAP API documentation](./src/api/axparameter/html/index.html) for detailed functional descriptions and examples of this API.

The AxParameter API allows the application to save data and application settings so that they are not lost during a restart or firmware upgrade of the Axis product.

AxParameter makes it possible to define callback functions that perform specific actions if a parameter is updated, for example if the user updates a parameter using the Axis product's web pages.

> **Note**
> Data that's only used and altered by the application should not be handled by AxParameter. Such data can instead be handled by, for example, GLib GKeyFile.

Parameters specific to the application can be pre-configured when the application is created or be added in runtime.

## Event API

Go to the [ACAP API documentation](./src/api/axevent/html/index.html) for detailed functional descriptions and examples of this API.

The Axevent API provides:

- an interface to the event system found in Axis products.
- applications with a mechanism for sending and receiving events.

An application can both send and receive events.

### Event types

- **Stateless (Pulse)** â€“ An event that indicates that something has occurred. Typically used to trigger some action rule.
- **Stateful (State)** â€“ An event with an active and inactive state. Typically used in action rules like "record while
active".
- **Data (Application Data)** â€“ An event that includes data that needs to be processed by the consuming application such as transaction data, license plate or other dynamic data. A data event is normally not used to trigger generic action rules.

### Supported Namespaces

When declaring events it is required to set a namespace. Following are the supported namespaces:

- `tnsaxis` â€“ Axis namespace to use with Axis events
- `tns1` â€“ ONVIF namespace to use with ONVIF events

### Compatibility

The API supports products with the following chips:

- ARTPEC-8
- ARTPEC-7
- ARTPEC-6

### Version history

| Event API version | ACAP API version | What's new |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 1.0               | ACAP 2           | Event API introduced |
| 1.1               | 3.2              | New functions:<br>- ax_event_new2<br>- ax_event_get_time_stamp2|

> **Note**
>
> - `ax_event_new` and `ax_event_get_time_stamp` functions are marked as deprecated from ACAP API version 3.2 because they use [GTimeVal](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/glib-Date-and-Time-Functions.html#GTimeVal), which is deprecated in glib. Use `ax_event_new2` and `x_event_get_time_stamp2` instead.
> - To prevent installation of an application (using the Event API) on unsupported firmware (version 10.2 and earlier),Â set `REQEMBDEVVERSION`Â to `2.18` (or higher) in `package.conf` or `manifest.json`.

### Code examples

#### Subscribe to and send event

This code example on [GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples/tree/master/axevent) illustrates both how to subscribe to different events and how to send an event.
