# Supported languages

The ACAP SDK is capable of building applications in various languages.

## Shell script

The build process requires a `Makefile`, even if nothing is being compiled. An empty `Makefile` is necessary to build shell script programs.

## C

Most of the examples are built using C and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples). The SDK uses gcc to compile C programs.

## C++

For an example of a C++ application, go to [using-opencv](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples/tree/master/using-opencv). The SDK uses g++ to compile C++ programs.
