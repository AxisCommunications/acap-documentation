# ACAP development requirements

To develop ACAP applications, you need the following:

- A computer with Linux, Windows, or macOS.
- Docker. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  - For Windows and macOS, use the automatically upgradable **Docker desktop stable**.
  - For Linux, use **Docker community edition** version 18.09 or later.
- Git scm. [Git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- We also recommend using **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**. But you are free to choose your favorite editor.
