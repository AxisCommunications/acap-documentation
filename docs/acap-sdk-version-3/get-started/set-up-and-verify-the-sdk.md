# Set up and verify the SDK

The ACAP SDK image, available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-sdk), is based on Ubuntu and contains the environment needed for building an AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) application. It includes all tools for building and packaging an ACAP 3 application as well as API components (header and library files) needed for accessing different parts of the camera firmware.

The SDK image can be used as a basis for custom built images to run your application, or as a developer environment inside the container.

To set up and verify the SDK, build, install and run the [Hello World](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples/tree/main/hello-world) example on GitHub.
