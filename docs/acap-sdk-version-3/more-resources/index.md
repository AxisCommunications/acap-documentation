# More resources

## Code examples and tutorials

Several ACAP application code examples and tutorials are open-sourced and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap3-examples).

Each example has a well-defined README file with the example structure on GitHub which will help you execute the examples on an Axis camera. The README file structure is comprised of:

- example description
- repository structure
- limitation
- how to build and run the code
- expected output

The tutorials have the same structure as the examples but are more extensive in content and scope.

We are continuously adding new examples and tutorials for both existing as well as for new functionality. Keep checking GitHub to stay updated with the latest changes.

## Developer community

[Axis Developer Community](https://www.axis.com/developer-community) is an Axis hosted site for developers that want to work with Axis devices.

On the community pages you'll find

- a wide array of documentation and tools that are useful when developing ACAP applications.
- documentation on, for example, how to integrate with Axis devices and other SDKs.
- a reference guide for all Axis devices supporting ACAP with information about chipset and memory resources.
- a Developer loan tool for running tests and trying out Axis products online.

## Product interface guide

The [Product interface guide](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/product-interface-guide) gives you information about architecture and chipset memory resources (RAM and flash) for all supported Axis devices. This information is helpful for finding out which SDK to use.
