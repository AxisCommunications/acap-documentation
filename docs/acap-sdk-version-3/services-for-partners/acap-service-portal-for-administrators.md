- Name and description for applications.
- Enable and setup the licensing service, such as trial or free licenses to users.
- Manage all aspects around licenses such as generating codes, and track and modify license keys.
- Configure compatibility between your application and Axis products.
- Sign ACAP packages to ensure authenticity, and to prevent tampering.
