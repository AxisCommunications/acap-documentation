# Beta API

A Beta version of an API is made for prototyping a solution early on in the
process to get feedback from developers.

> A Beta API should not be used for production, it's likely to introduce
> breaking changes.

## Test and leave feedback

Application developers are encouraged to test Beta APIs and leave feedback.

The best way to leave feedback is to use the GitHub issue tracker of the Beta
API implementation (for example if the prototype is an ACAP application image)
or in the Beta API example if there is one available.

### ACAP Runtime and Parameter API

Feedback on the service and API can be given in the [ACAP Computer Vision SDK
examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples/issues)
issue tracker.
