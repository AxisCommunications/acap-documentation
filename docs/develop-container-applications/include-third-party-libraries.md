# Include third party libraries

## ACAP Computer Vision solution

From AXIS OS 12.0, the setup is based on installing public Python packages,
i.e. no compilation as was the case for previous releases. Usage can be found
in [ACAP Computer Vision SDK
examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples).
