# Supported languages

Supported languages for building ACAP applications with ACAP Native SDK.

## C

Most of the examples are built using C and can be found in the [acap-native-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples) GitHub repository.
The SDK uses gcc to compile C programs.

## C++

To see an example of a C++ application, please see the [using-opencv](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/using-opencv) example.
The SDK uses g++ to compile C++ programs.

## Shell script

The build process requires a Makefile, even if nothing is being compiled. An empty Makefile is necessary to build shell script programs. To see an example of a hello world application written in shell script using manifest, please see [shell-script-example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/shell-script-example).
