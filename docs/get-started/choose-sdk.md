# Choose SDK

The ACAP SDK images are based on Ubuntu and contain the environment needed for building an AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) application. All images are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/axisecp).

An SDK image can be used as a basis for custom built images to run your application, or as a developer environment inside the container. See examples in the sections below for help on how to do this.

Depending on your use case, use the [ACAP Native SDK](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk), [ACAP Computer Vision SDK](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk) or a combination of both. Remember to check [compatibility](../axis-devices-and-compatibility) for your product before getting started.
