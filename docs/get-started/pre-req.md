# Pre-requisites
To develop ACAPs, you need the following:

- A computer with Linux, Windows, or MacOS.
- Docker. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
  - For Windows and MacOS, use the automatically upgradable **Docker desktop stable**.
  - For Linux, use **Docker community edition** version 18.09 or later.
- GIT scm. [GIT downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- We also recommend using Microsoft **Visual Studio Code**. But you are free to choose your favorite editor.
