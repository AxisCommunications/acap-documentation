# Pre-requisites

To develop ACAP applications, you need the following:

- A computer with Linux, Windows, or macOS.
- Docker ([download](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
  - For Windows and macOS, use the automatically upgradable **Docker desktop stable**.
  - For Linux, use **Docker community edition** version 18.09 or later.
- Git ([download](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
- We also recommend using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). But you are free to choose your favorite editor.
