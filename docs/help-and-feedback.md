The best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. You can get help and provide feedback by creating an issue or a discussion in the following repositories:

- [ACAP Native SDK](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk)
- [ACAP Native SDK examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples)
- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk)
- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples)

For questions unrelated to the existing repositories we have the [general ACAP discussions](https://github.com/orgs/AxisCommunications/discussions/categories/acap). Feel free to ask your question there.

For feedback and issues regarding this documentation, please create an issue or a pull request in [acap-documentation](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-documentation/issues).

You may also find additional information by joining our [Developer Community](https://www.axis.com/developer-community) and can get the latest development news from Axis.
