# ACAP examples

There are several AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) code examples and tutorials available with an open-source license for both the ACAP Native SDK and ACAP Computer Vision SDK. Each example has a well-defined README file and example structure which will help you execute the examples on an Axis camera. The README file structure is comprised of:

* example description
* repository structure
* limitation
* how to build and run the code
* expected output

We are continuously adding new examples and tutorials for both existing as well as for new functionality. Keep checking the Axis [GitHub organization](https://github.com/AxisCommunications) to stay updated with the latest changes.

### Report issues
If you have any comments or questions, or if you are having problems with the
examples, please open an issue in the relevant GitHub repository, see
[Get help & give feedback](../help-and-feedback).
