# Version history

AXIS Camera Application Platform (ACAP) was introduced already in 2009 and is
the world’s first camera-based video analytics platform. Over the years, the
ACAP concept has gradually expanded allowing more types of applications,
introducing new APIs and exposing more of the device hardware for analytics.

## ACAP version 12 and higher

* The ACAP LTS scope is aligned to AXIS OS LTS scope that is kept within the
  same major.
* The ACAP version is aligned to AXIS OS version.

## ACAP version 1–4

* These ACAP versions span multiple LTS releases and can be seen as a
  generation where a step of major has marked a significant change, e.g. in
  technology or in the offering, like a new type of SDK.
