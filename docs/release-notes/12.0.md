## New additions

- Starting with version 12.0, the ACAP release version and the ACAP Native SDK version align with the
  major and minor of [AXIS OS
versioning](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os#axis-os-versioning) going forward.
For more details, see the [ACAP version
comparison](../introduction/acap-version-comparison#acap-version-12).
- The ACAP Native SDK base container image has stepped to Ubuntu 24.04.
- Manifest schema updates:
  - New version: 1.7.1
    - Allow `user` and `group` names to contain hyphens `-`.
    - Force `appName` to start with a regular letter and have length of at least 2.

## Changes

- Security uplift:
  - From AXIS OS 12.0, root-privileged access is removed in AXIS OS.
    - For reference, see the announcement on Axis Developer Community about
      [Removal of root-privileged access and ACAP application signing as
default](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing).
  - From AXIS OS 12.0, signing of ACAP applications will be required by
    default, but can still be disabled with a toggle. Signing is planned to
    become mandatory in a future major AXIS OS release.
- The list of system-on-chips (SoCs) with [ACAP Native SDK hardware
  compatibility](../axis-devices-and-compatibility/#acap-native-sdk-hardware-compatibility)
has been updated. Products with the following SoCs have been removed from AXIS OS active track
and will stay on AXIS OS 2024 LTS in the [AXIS OS
lifecycle](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os#axis-os-lifecycle)
  - Ambarella S5L
  - Ambarella S5
  - i.MX 6SoloX
  - i.MX 6ULL
- The ACAP Computer Vision SDK has been refactored and renamed ACAP Computer
  Vision solution.
  - The ACAP Computer Vision SDK repository and images have been archived as
    its components have been refactored: utility libraries and scripts are now
available in [ACAP
Runtime](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime).
  - For usage of the new setup, see the
    [acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples)
repository.
- The ACAP Computer Vision solution is marked as deprecated.
  - New Axis products released on AXIS OS 12.x will not have container support.
  - All products with existing container support will be supported until end of
    2031 when AXIS OS 2026 LTS reaches end of life.
  - The recommended way to build analytics, computer vision and machine
    learning applications on Axis devices with ACAP support, is to use the ACAP
    Native SDK. For usage see the
    [acap-native-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples)
    repository.
- The Metadata Broker API has been renamed to [Message Broker
  API](../api/src/api/message-broker/html/index.html).
- The documentation has been restructured to keep development of [native ACAP
  applications](../develop) and [container
applications](../develop-container-applications) separate to make it clearer
what content applies to which solution.

## Bug fixes

- An issue where applications with an underscore `_` in their `appName` could
  not update parameter values has been fixed.
