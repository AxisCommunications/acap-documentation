# ACAP version 4.1 â€“ January 13, 2022

## Overview

It contains:

- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK 1.1](#acap-computer-vision-sdk)
- [ACAP Native SDK 1.1](#acap-native-sdk)
- [Docker ACAP 1.1.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/docker-acap)
- [Docker Compose ACAP 1.1.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/docker-compose-acap)

Code examples for both SDKs:

- [Code examples ACAP Computer Vision SDK v1.1](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples/tree/v1.1)
- [Code examples ACAP Native SDK v1.1](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/v1.1)

## New features

- Support for architecture-independent applications (shell scripts or client-side web applications)
- Support for 64 bit artpec-8 devices
- For manifest ACAP applications, from manifest schema version 1.3, the [architecture](../axis-devices#find-the-right-sdk-for-hardware-compatibilityis) is added to manifest.json at the packaging step. If a script application is not architecture dependent, applications can add  `"architecture" : "all"` in manifest.json, see [shell-script-example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/blob/master/shell-script-example/app/manifest.json).

## New examples

[Custom library example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/master/utility-libraries/custom_lib_example) - This example explains how to build a user defined custom library from source files and bundle it for use in an ACAP application.
