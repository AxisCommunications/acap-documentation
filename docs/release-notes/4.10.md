## New features

- From [AXIS OS 11.5](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-11-5), an [interface is added to VAPIX](https://www.axis.com/vapix-library/subjects/t10102231/section/t10036126/display?section=t10036126-t10185050) to control whether an Axis device only accepts root-privileged access for ACAP applications or not, improving the device's security. For more information regarding the reasoning for this change, and its timeline, see the [article on Developer Community](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing).
- From [AXIS OS 11.6](https://help.axis.com/en-us/axis-os-release-notes#axis-os-11-6), ACAP applications can acquire VAPIX service account credentials in runtime. With these credentials, the ACAP application can call a local virtual host to make VAPIX requests on the device. Read more in [VAPIX access for ACAP applications - BETA](../develop/VAPIX-access-for-ACAP-applications).

### Fixes

- The [ACAP Computer Vision SDK examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples) are now using Docker Compose V2 since V1 is no longer receiving updates nor is it available in new releases of Docker Desktop. This means that the previous `docker-compose` that required separate installation has been replaced by `docker compose` which is part of the Docker client.

## ACAP Native SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk)

### Compatibility

Supported products:

- All products with chipsets: ARTPEC-8, ARTPEC-7, ARTPEC-6, CV25, i.MX 6SoloX, i.MX 6ULL, S5L and S5.

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).

### Updates

- `acap-build` has now more granular build options to allow different build setups of ACAP
applications. Run `acap-build --help` for more information. The new options are:
  - Skipping the build step (`--build no-build`).
  - Disabling manifest validation (`--disable-manifest-validation`).
  - Disabling package creation (`--disable-package-creation`).
