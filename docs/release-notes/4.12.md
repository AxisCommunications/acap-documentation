  ([Release notes](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/releases/tag/v1.12))

### New features

- Manifest schema [1.5.0](../develop/manifest-schemas/schema-field-descriptions-v1.5.0):
  - Add support for reverse proxy configuration. See [web-server-example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/blob/main/web-server/app/manifest.json)

  - Add support to set access policy for ACAP application web content.\
  It is possible now to define which users have access to the ACAP application web content by adding the following configuration to the manifest file, where `access` can be `admin`, `viewer` or `operator`

     ```json
     "acapPackageConf": {
       "configuration": {
         "httpConfig": [
           {
             "access": "admin",
             "type": "directory"
           }
         ]
       }
     }
     ```

  - Allow `-` character in secondary groups of `linux` resources. See example:

     ```json
     "resources": {
       "linux": {
         "user": {
           "groups": [ "basic-device-info" ]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

  - Allow strings in `requiredMethods` and `conditionalMethods` under `dbus` to end with `.*` to match all methods of a D-Bus interface. See example:

     ```json
     "resources": {
       "dbus": {
         "requiredMethods": [
           "com.axis.Graphics2.*"
         ],
         "conditionalMethods": [
           "com.axis.Overlay2.*"
         ]
     }
     ```

### Firmware

- Minimum AXIS OS version: 11.8

See [Firmware releases](https://www.axis.com/support/firmware) for all supported products.

### Limitations

From AXIS OS 11.8 `root` user is not allowed by default and in 12.0 it will be disallowed completely. Read more on the [Developer Community](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing).

This affects the following features:

- The reverse proxy was previously set up via a post-install script which requires `root` privileges. To set up a reverse proxy without `root`, a new field has been added in manifest schema 1.5.0. See how the setup can be done in [manifest.json](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/blob/main/web-server/app/manifest.json) of the updated `web-server` example.
- Docker ACAP 1.X requires `root` and work is ongoing to create a version that does not. Meanwhile, the solution is to allow `root` to be able to install the Docker ACAP.
  - On the web page of the device:
    1. Go to the Apps page, toggle on `Allow root-privileged apps`.
    2. Go to System -> Account page, under SSH accounts toggle off `Restrict root access` to be able to send the TLS certificates. Make sure to set the password of the `root` SSH user.
