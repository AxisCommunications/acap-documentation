Device software:

- Minimum [AXIS OS](https://www.axis.com/support/device-software) version: 11.10

## New features

- The following APIs have been added to the ACAP Native SDK:
  - [Curl](../api/native-sdk-api.md#curl) -
      An open-source library for transferring data with URLs.
  - [Jansson](../api/native-sdk-api.md#jansson) -
      An open-source library for encoding, decoding and manipulating JSON data.
  - [OpenSSL](../api/native-sdk-api.md#openssl) -
      An open-source library for general-purpose cryptography and secure communication.
- Manifest schema [1.7.0](../develop/manifest-schemas/schema-field-descriptions-v1.7.0):
  - Make preparations on the host system so the application can run containers,
    and create symbolic links from various system-wide locations to Docker CLIs provided by the application.

    ```json
    "acapPackageConf": {
        "configuration": {
            "containers": {
                "containerHost": true,
                "createDockerSymlinks": true
            }
        }
    }
    ```

  - Docker ACAP and Docker Compose ACAP are now rootless as part of the [removal of root-privileged access](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing) initiative

## Bug fixes

- A bug affecting ACAP applications that have specified multiple UDS sockets in their reverse proxy configuration, was causing traffic to get routed to the wrong internal socket from the application. It has been fixed in AXIS OS 11.10.

## Limitations

- There is a limitation with Docker ACAP 3.0.0 and Docker compose ACAP 3.0.0
  - Only uid and gid are properly mapped between device and containers, not the secondary groups that the user is a member of. This means that resources on the device, even if they are volume or device mounted, can be inaccessible inside the container. This can also affect usage of unsupported D-Bus methods from the container. See [Using host user secondary groups in container](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap#using-host-user-secondary-groups-in-container) for information on how to handle this.

## Upcoming changes

- Axis is planning to introduce signing of ACAP applications as default and remove root-privileged access in future AXIS OS releases.
For reference see the announcement on Axis Developer Community about [Removal of root-privileged access and ACAP application signing as default](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing)
- The next SDK release, 1.15 is going to be the last for the computer vision sdk on armv7hf. Support will continue for aarch64 devices.
