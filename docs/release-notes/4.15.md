Device software:

- Minimum [AXIS OS](https://www.axis.com/support/device-software) version: 11.11

## New additions

- Documentation on how to enable [Developer Mode](../get-started/set-up-developer-environment/set-up-device-advanced#developer-mode) on an Axis device, that allows to `ssh` into an Axis device as an ACAP application user has been added. This solution is important for developers from AXIS OS 12.0 when it will not be possible to `ssh` as `root`.
- An example called [remote-debug-example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/remote-debug-example) has been added to the acap-native-sdk-examples and explains the process of debugging an ACAP application running on an Axis device by using GDB, Visual Studio Code and Developer Mode.
- The following API has been added to the ACAP Native SDK:
  - [Bounding Box API](../api/native-sdk-api#bounding-box-api) - A simple API for drawing bounding boxes on the scene. It comes with an example [bounding-box](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/bounding-box).
- A [new guide](../develop/user-selection) on how to migrate an application from static to dynamic user has been added to the documentation.
- A new [consumable topic](https://axiscommunications.github.io/acap-documentation/docs/api/src/api/message-broker/html/standard_topics.html) for Metadata Broker API is available.

## Changes

- The [ACAP Service Portal](https://axiscommunications.github.io/acap-documentation/docs/service/acap-service-portal) service to sign an ACAP application now verifies the application's manifest.json against the latest manifest schema available, in the same major series, at that point in time.
- The [Metadata Broker API](../api/native-sdk-api#message-broker-api) has undergone a breaking change.
The symbols `on_metadata` and `mdb_metadata_payload_t` have been deprecated and replaced with `on_message` and `mdb_message_payload_t`, respectively. Check out the [metadata-broker](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/message-broker/consume-analytics-scene-description) example which has been updated to reflect these changes.
- The `eap-install.sh` script in the Native SDK now allows specifying an admin user instead of the default `root` user. Find more details in the [build, install, run](../develop/build-install-run.html#install-the-application) documentation page.

## Bug fixes

- An issue where the user of an ACAP application could lose its UID during AXIS OS or application upgrade has been fixed in AXIS OS.
- The OpenCL version in ACAP Native SDK was discovered to have been `3.0.0` since the first SDK release, which is not according to documentation, where `1.2.0` is stated.
There should be no functional change between `1.2.0` and `3.0.0` and a fix in AXIS OS has been added where both versions exist to keep backwards compatibility.

## Upcoming changes

- After the next LTS release, the ACAP release version will be aligned with the AXIS OS release version, which means a step for ACAP version from 4.X to 12.0.
- Security uplift:
  - From AXIS OS 12.0, signing of ACAP applications will be required by default, but can still be disabled with a toggle. Signing is planned to become mandatory in a future AXIS OS release.
  - From AXIS OS 12.0, root-privileged access is removed in AXIS OS.
  - For reference, see the announcement on Axis Developer Community about [Removal of root-privileged access and ACAP application signing as default](https://www.axis.com/developer-community/news/axis-os-root-acap-signing)
- This release is the last for the Computer Vision SDK on `armv7hf`.
