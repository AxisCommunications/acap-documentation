### Firmware

- Minimum AXIS OS version: 10.12

See [Firmware releases](https://www.axis.com/support/firmware) for all supported products.

### Limitations

- All examples using the larod-inference-server container image currently require the following volume mount to be added to the compose file: `/usr/acap-root/lib:/host/lib` e.g.

```yaml
    volumes:
      - acap_dl-models:/models
      - /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
      - /usr/acap-root/lib:/host/lib
 ```

- The [Parameter-API in Python](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples/tree/main/parameter-api-python) example is not currently working on aarch64 cameras but is expected to be fixed for next release.

## Corrections in release notes

[^1]: The structure of the ACAP Computer Vision SDK compatible products has been updated and are now grouped in product families. As a result, some models have been added. Also, we are only including the new products in the release notes, you can still find the complete list in [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).
