## Corrections in release notes

[^1]: The structure of the ACAP Computer Vision SDK compatible products has been updated and are now grouped in product families. As a result, some models have been added. Also, we are only including the new products in the release notes, you can still find the complete list in [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).
[^2]: The device AXIS Q1798-LE was added by mistake to the list of computer vision compatible devices.
