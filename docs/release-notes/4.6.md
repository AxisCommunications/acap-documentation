# ACAP version 4.6 â€“ January 13, 2023

## Overview

It contains:

- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK 1.6](#acap-computer-vision-sdk)
- [ACAP Native SDK 1.6](#acap-native-sdk)
- [ACAP Runtime 1.2.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-runtime)
- [Docker ACAP 1.3.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap)
- [Docker Compose ACAP 1.2.5](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap)

Code examples for both SDKs:

- [Code examples ACAP Computer Vision SDK v1.6](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples)
- [Code examples ACAP Native SDK v1.6](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples)

### New features

- A new VAPIX API to toggle allowance of unsigned ACAP applications. See the API specifications in the [VAPIX documentation](https://www.axis.com/vapix-library/subjects/t10102231/section/t10036126/display?section=t10036126-t10185050).

### New examples

- [web-server-using-fastcgi](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/web-server-using-fastcgi) - This example in C shows how to handle HTTP requests sent to the Axis device using FastCGI to handle the requests and uriparser to parse received parameters. Differently to the [web-server](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/web-server) example, the request is handled by the Apache web server in the device, which is beneficial in terms of service discoverability, since it will be using the standard HTTP port, and security, since the requests will have the same level of authentication as any other VAPIX request.

### Firmware

- Minimum AXIS OS version: 11.2

See [Firmware releases](https://www.axis.com/support/firmware) for all supported products.

### Fixes

- ACAP application examples using the ACAP Runtime were reported to crash when running over long periods of time. The problem has been resolved in acap-runtime 1.2.0.

### Limitations

- All examples using the larod-inference-server container image currently require the following volume mount to be added to the compose file: `/usr/acap-root/lib:/host/lib` e.g.

  ```yaml
      volumes:
        - acap_dl-models:/models
        - /run/dbus/system_bus_socket:/run/dbus/system_bus_socket
        - /usr/acap-root/lib:/host/lib
   ```

## ACAP Native SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk)

### Compatibility

Supported products:

- All products with chipsets: ARTPEC-8, ARTPEC-7, ARTPEC-6, CV25, S5L and S5.

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).

### Fixes

- The [openssl_curl_example](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/utility-libraries/openssl_curl_example) example is now building with the new SDK version.

## Corrections in release notes

[^1]: The structure of the ACAP Computer Vision SDK compatible products has been updated and are now grouped in product families. As a result, some models have been added. Also, we are only including the new products in the release notes, you can still find the complete list in [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).
[^2]: The device AXIS Q1798-LE was added by mistake to the list of computer vision compatible devices.
[^3]: FastCGI was added in this release but did not enter the release notes at the release date. A new example [web-server-using-fastcgi](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/web-server-using-fastcgi) was also added and shows how to use the API.
[^4]: The list of chips that support FastCGI is now corrected to also include ARTPEC-6, S5L and S5.
