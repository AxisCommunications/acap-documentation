# ACAP version 4.8 â€“ April 24, 2023

## Overview

It contains:

- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK 1.8](#acap-computer-vision-sdk)
- [ACAP Native SDK 1.8](#acap-native-sdk)
- [ACAP Runtime 1.2.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime)
- [Docker ACAP 1.3.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap)
- [Docker Compose ACAP 1.3.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap)

Code examples for both SDKs:

- [Code examples ACAP Computer Vision SDK v1.8](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples)
- [Code examples ACAP Native SDK v1.8](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples)

### Firmware

- Minimum AXIS OS version: 11.4

See [Firmware releases](https://www.axis.com/support/firmware) for all supported products.

## ACAP Computer Vision SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-computer-vision-sdk)

### Compatibility

No new supported products.

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility) for the complete list of
supported products and more product information.

## ACAP Native SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk)

### Compatibility

Supported products:

- All products with chipsets: ARTPEC-8, ARTPEC-7, ARTPEC-6, CV25, S5L and S5.

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).

### Updates

- The Machine Learning API (Larod) version 1 is soon to be deprecated and developers will in build time see this warning:

  ~~~text
  /opt/axis/acapsdk/sysroots/armv7hf/usr/include/larod.h:26:2: warning: #warning "API version 1 is deprecated and will be removed soon. "
  ~~~

  The following examples of the [acap-native-sdk-examples](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples) repository have been updated to use the latest Larod version 3.
  - [vdo-larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/vdo-larod)
  - [object-detection](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/object-detection)
  - [object-detection-cv25](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/object-detection-cv25)

### Deprecation

- After the update to Larod 3, the example [vdo-larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/vdo-larod) now covers the use cases that required separate examples on Larod usage. The following examples are therefore deprecated and removed in this release, but found in previous release tag:
  - [larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/v1.7/larod)
  - [vdo-larod-preprocessing](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/v1.7/vdo-larod-preprocessing)
