# ACAP version 4.9 â€“ June 26, 2023

## Overview

It contains:

- [ACAP Computer Vision SDK 1.9](#acap-computer-vision-sdk)
- [ACAP Native SDK 1.9](#acap-native-sdk)
- [ACAP Runtime 1.3.1](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-runtime)
- [Docker ACAP 1.4.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap)
- [Docker Compose ACAP 1.3.0](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap)

Code examples for both SDKs:

- [Code examples ACAP Computer Vision SDK v1.9](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-computer-vision-sdk-examples)
- [Code examples ACAP Native SDK v1.9](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples)

## New features

- From 1.4.0, the [Docker ACAP](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-acap) application will also be distributed as a signed ACAP application, available on GitHub. From 1.5.0, the application will only be distributed through GitHub, i.e. it will no longer be distributed as a Docker image.
- From 1.3.0, the [Docker Compose ACAP](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/docker-compose-acap) application will also be distributed as a signed ACAP application, available on GitHub. From 1.4.0, the application will only be distributed through GitHub, i.e. it will no longer be distributed as a Docker image.

### Firmware

- Minimum AXIS OS version: 11.5

See [Firmware releases](https://www.axis.com/support/firmware) for all supported products.

## ACAP Computer Vision SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-computer-vision-sdk)

### Compatibility

New supported products:

- AXIS Q3626-VE Dome Camera, [Product page](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q3626-ve)
- AXIS Q3628-VE Dome Camera, [Product page](https://www.axis.com/products/axis-q3628-ve)

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility) for the complete list of
supported products and more product information.

## ACAP Native SDK

Supported architectures:

- armv7hf and aarch64, see [images on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/axisecp/acap-native-sdk)

### Compatibility

Supported products:

- All products with chipsets: ARTPEC-8, ARTPEC-7, ARTPEC-6, CV25, i.MX 6SoloX, i.MX 6ULL, S5L and S5.

See also [compatibility information](../axis-devices-and-compatibility).

### Updates

- The [tensorflow-to-larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/tensorflow-to-larod) example (also for [ARTPEC-8](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/tensorflow-to-larod-artpec8) and [CV25](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/tensorflow-to-larod-cv25)) previously consisted of creating a model and deploying it in an ACAP application. The last part, deploying the model in an ACAP application was a copy of the [vdo-larod](https://github.com/AxisCommunications/acap-native-sdk-examples/tree/main/vdo-larod) example and has been removed.

- Audio products are now supported, which means you will now be able to find two extra chipsets:
  - i.MX 6SoloX
  - i.MX 6ULL

### Fixes

- Parameters in *param.conf* with empty values were not converted when using `packageconf2manifest.py`. This has now been fixed.
