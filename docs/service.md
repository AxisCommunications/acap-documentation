## Package signing
The sign package service is available in the ACAP Service Portal, and requires ADP access.

By signing an ACAP package you make sure that the content of the package is not tampered with between the release and installation on the Axis device.

During the signing process, a signature is added at the end of the package. The signature is verified by the device when installing the ACAP.

Support for verifying signed ACAPs was introduced in firmware 9.20. The format as such is fully backward compatible. A signed ACAP can be installed on devices with a firmware earlier than 9.20, in which case itâ€™s not verified by the device.

## ACAP Service Portal for administrators
Use the ACAP Service Portal for administrators to register new applications compatible with Axis products, and to manage all related information such as:

- Name and description for applications.
- Enable and setup the licensing service, such as trial or free licenses to users.
- Manage all aspects around licenses such as generating codes, and track and modify license keys.
- Configure compatibility between your application and Axis products.
- Sign ACAP packages to ensure authenticity, and to prevent tampering.
