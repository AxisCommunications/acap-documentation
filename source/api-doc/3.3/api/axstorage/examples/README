AXStorage Example

This application shows the developers how to use the APIs of axstorage.
The application does the following:
  List configured storage devices.
  Subscribe to the events of all storage devices.
  Setup (start using) all available/mounted storage devices.
  Write two files and keep writing data to the files to all available storage
    devices as long as they are available.
  If any storage device disappears (unmounted), release it from being used.
